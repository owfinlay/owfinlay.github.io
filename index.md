I've a blog now-- this should be **fun**!

Hello! I'm Oliver. I have too much education and no solid talents or expertise. This is okay, because I am only 22. I have a bachelor's in neuroscience and I like podcasts where they use Smart People Words (SPWs) (and a personal favorite podcast is COMPLEXITY from the Santa Fe Institute). I would like to someday also use SPWs. It would be even better if people believe that I know what these words mean; and if I'm really, really lucky, maybe those people will come out of the conversation understanding some of them as well.
