# Heyo! This is the grand inauguration of this stupid thing that is only the newest iteration in a line of stupid things.

I've tried a few different blog-generating mechanisms and I think this is the one I'll stick with, because it looks much easier to use than Nikola and faster/less bloated than Wordpress

## Plans yadda yadda

I want to talk about the things I'm learning here... And practice posing questions to myself that can draw out the most meaningful lessons from those things. 

I'm talking without thinking because I'm extremely uncomfortable.
